# Nonlinear Mixed Effects MCMC 
## A package for performing Bayesian inference with a Nonlinear Mixed Effects (NLME) model (aka, Hierarchical Bayesian model) with MCMC

This code wraps the [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) python module, providing scripts for: building a Bayesian Hierarchical model, running MCMC to convergence (and giving informative running diagnostic plots and information), plotting the posterior density, and calculating the marginal likelihood associated to the chosen model hypothesis.

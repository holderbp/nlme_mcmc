where, recall, that initial virus concentration [V] in terms of the
virus inoculation volume, v, is:

[V] = v / (300uL + v)

and the inoculation is followed 24h later by a dilution of 1mL medium,
so I must let (approximately) V -> V/4 at that time.

The "individual-data" directories contain directories for the raw
counts after running my flow cytometry gating script, and thel

And then I am creating a spreadsheet containing all data:

hiv_tcells_all-data.xlsx

and its individual sheets

hiv_tcells_all-data_ACT.csv
hiv_tcells_all-data_REST.csv
hiv_tcells_all-data_ECp.csv
hiv_tcells_all-data_ECm.csv
